Are you about to begin your 3rd year of your UTS Computing Science (Honours) course and you have (like me) realised that your patience for all of this is wearing thin? It is actually possible to transfer from the [4 year honours version (C09119)](https://www.uts.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-computing-science-honours) of the computing science course to the [3 year non-honours version (C10476)](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/course/2026/c10476).

Before you begin, please be aware that:

- This guide has been written in 2026, by a CompSci student starting her honours-embedded degree in 2023. Hence, the version of the course I started with was [C09119v2](https://handbookpre2025.uts.edu.au/2023/courses/c09119.html) and the version of the course I graduated with is [C10476v3](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/course/2026/c10476). Furthermore, I majored in [Enterprise Systems Development Major](https://handbookpre2025.uts.edu.au/2023/directory/maj03444.html), so my guide only serves as an example for what subjects to choose. Your own major may require additional research for the transfer process.

- The latest version of the 3 year non-honours course is (still not) Australian Computing Society accredited. This may change in the coming year as this course is now offered to new students and not just for transfers. Please talk to your [course director](https://www.uts.edu.au/for-students/current-students/managing-your-course/current-students-information-engineering-and-information-technology/faculty-contacts) if this suits you.

- Many thanks to Oli of the [UTS ProgSoc](https://progsoc.org/) [Discord Server](https://progsoc.org/discord/) for first detailing this in [this thread](https://discord.com/channels/504971400394702858/1285447217561210981). If you have any questions regarding this process, please feel free to shoot a message there.

With all that being said the process is as follows:

## Reading Up

The process to do this is officially known as a "Course Transfer - Graduation" or a "Course Transfer to Graduate". You can read up about this process [here](https://www.uts.edu.au/for-students/current-students/managing-your-course/your-enrolment/enrolment-changes/course-transfer#ctgraduating). However, the official UTS documents are rather vague, so this is what this guide is for.

## Completing all Core and Major Components of Your Current Course

The most important part of the process is to make sure that you are to complete all __Core__ and __Major__ components of your current course (C10476). This will mean that you may need to forgo certain honours-specific courses in favour of those __Core__ and __Major__ components within your last semesters in order to achieve this and be eligible for graduation. If this is not possible, you will have to finish those components later on, possibly delaying your graduation.

As an example, I was to do [Technology Research Preparation](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/subject/2026/32144) for my honours portion in the second semester of my third-year. However, I opted to do [Advanced Software Development](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/subject/2026/41026) instead to be able to complete the components for my [Enterprise Systems Development Major](https://handbookpre2025.uts.edu.au/2023/directory/maj03444.html). The following is a screenshot of my online student record that shows this:

## Contacting Your Course Director (Highly Recommended)

Once you have done this, I __highly recommend__ talking to your course director about your plan to transfer. During my study at UTS, my course director for the honours computing science course was the excellent Angela Huo. Please note that you can find the course director on [this UTS page](https://www.uts.edu.au/for-students/current-students/managing-your-course/current-students-information-engineering-and-information-technology/faculty-contacts). Clicking on their profile will give you an email address. An example email is as follows:


```
Hi, I hope this email finds you well.

I had heard from one of the members of the programming society (Oli) that he had successfully transfered from the 4 year Honours course for Computing Science (C09119v2) to a non-honours 3 year degree (C10476v2). After hearing about this, I figured that I would like to also attempt to do the same. Given that this is my 3rd year at UTS, I would like to make it my last undergraduate year if possible.

Oli had said that those that would potentially want to transfer would "need to complete all the Core and Major components of your current course (C09119)". I am currently doing the enterprise systems development major for my Computing Science Honours degree (C09119v2), and have enrolled in subjects such that all core subjects of Computing Science (STM91173) and the Enterprise Systems Development major (MAJ03519) will be completed this year.

Kind regards,
Amy

Once you send this email, you will receive an automated response with a link to make a meeting booking and a form to complete before the meeting. Make a booking for a meeting and make sure that you complete the form as the course director will not be able to help you during your meeting if you have not. The most important part of the form is where it asks to "Please download your study plan from StuAdmin and upload it here". The instruction are rather vague so I will document how to do this:

1. Log into [MyStudentAdmin](https://mystudentadmin.uts.edu.au/) and navigate to Subjects > Study Plan Status and Structure.

2. Click on the "Email a Study Plan Advice to my UTS email account" button.
![email study plan](/blog/dropping-uts-compsci-honours-guide/email-study-plan.png)

3. An email from UTSStudentCentres.DoNotReply@uts.edu.au will arrive in your in box in 5-10 minutes containing a document that looks like this: ![online study plan](/blog/dropping-uts-compsci-honours-guide/online-study-plan.png)

4. Upload said document to the form and submit.

During your meeting with your course director, she will ask you why you want to transfer and if you are currently working or any upcoming opportunities if you were to graduate shortly. Each meeting is only confined to 10 minutes so keep it short. Course directors are very busy and now even busier to due the staff shortage that UTS higher-ups are putting the university under, so please be patient!

## Submitting the Course Transfer - Graduating form

Once you are given approval from your course director that a potential transfer will be approved. Submit a [Course Transfer - Graduating](https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/2022-01/SAU-Course-Transfer-Graduating-2022.pdf) form on [AskUTS Student Portal](https://student-portal.uts.edu.au/s/enquiry?name=A-0030) in your ideally last semester of study. For example, my successful transfer form had the following fields filled out:

![online study plan](/blog/dropping-uts-compsci-honours-guide/transfer-form.png)

__Please note__ that the under the course version [C10476v3](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/course/2026/c10476), there are no majors unlike [C09119](https://coursehandbook.uts.edu.au/course/2026/c09119). However, the majors that exist in [C09119] have similarly-named sub-majors that you can transfer your major components to, hence why my form looks the way it does.

### Waiting

A few weeks after submission, you will be sent an email like the following:

![pending email](/blog/dropping-uts-compsci-honours-guide/transfer-pending-email.png)

Afterwards, in about a months time if you have passed all your subjects for the semester you will be given an email like such:

![complete email](/blog/dropping-uts-compsci-honours-guide/transfer-complete-email.png)

## Submitting the Course Completion Form

As described by the above email, all that is left to do is apply for conferral on [MyStudentAdmin](https://mystudentadmin.uts.edu.au/) by navigating to Graduation > Course Completion.

## Addendum

Once again, many thanks to Oli of the [UTS ProgSoc](https://progsoc.org/) [Discord Server](https://progsoc.org/discord/) for first detailing this process. Please check them out. As of current writing, ProgSoc is under great leadership and is a great way to find other like-minded people in your course, as well as inquire about course and subject information like this.
